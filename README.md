# Project 3: Mastering Node.js Web Development with Fastify

In Project 3, I embarked on a journey to achieve several important learning objectives:

## Learning Objectives

- **Interpreting Specifications Efficiently:**
  I developed proficiency in interpreting functional descriptions and specifications, enabling me to complete assignments effectively.

- **Project Breakdown Skills:**
  I gained experience in breaking down projects into manageable components, which facilitated efficient development.

- **Node.js Web Development:**
  I enhanced my skills in writing and executing Node.js JavaScript code, both for non-web server and web server applications, using Visual Studio Code (VSCode) as my development environment.

- **Modularizing Codebase:**
  I practiced creating and utilizing code modules to organize and modularize my codebase effectively, promoting code reusability and maintainability.

- **Modern JavaScript Refactoring:**
  I refined my knowledge of modern JavaScript syntax through refactoring existing code, ensuring cleaner and more efficient code structures.

- **Building a Web Server with Fastify:**
  I gained practical experience in building and running a web server using Node.js and the Fastify package. This included handling GET requests, defining routes, and processing query parameters.

- **Serving Content to Clients:**
  I learned how to load a file and use it as a web page to serve content to clients, enhancing the user experience of my web server application.

## Overview

The main task of this project was to create a "coinage" code module capable of calculating the total value of coin objects. Once the functionality of the "coinage" code module was completed, I updated the "server" code file to function as a true Node.js web server using the Fastify package.

The updated "server" file served an initial web page with web links to test the "coinage" code. The initial web page was loaded from a file, providing a seamless and interactive experience for users accessing my web server.

Through this project, I not only strengthened my Node.js development skills but also gained valuable experience in building and deploying web servers, further expanding my repertoire as a web developer.
