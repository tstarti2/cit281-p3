## Project 3 Learning Objectives

Upon successful completion of this project, participants will:

- Develop proficiency in interpreting functional descriptions and specifications to complete an assignment effectively.
- Gain experience in breaking down a project into manageable components for efficient development.
- Enhance their skills in writing and executing Node.js JavaScript code for non-web server and web server applications using Visual Studio Code (VSCode).
- Practice creating and utilizing code modules to organize and modularize their codebase effectively.
- Refine their knowledge of modern JavaScript syntax through refactoring existing code.
- Gain practical experience in building and running a web server using Node.js and the Fastify package, including handling GET requests, defining routes, and processing query parameters.
- Gain experience in loading a file and using it as a web page to serve content to clients.

## Overview

Participants will create a "coinage" code module capable of calculating the total value of coin objects. Once the functionality of the "coinage" code module is completed, participants will update the "server" code file to function as a true Node.js web server using the Fastify package. The updated "server" file will serve an initial web page with web links to test the "coinage" code. The initial web page will be loaded from a file.
